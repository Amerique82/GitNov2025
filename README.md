Modernising my technical stack through MSc Web Development at the University of Roehampton. With a foundation in systems engineering (C++, Visual FoxPro, database architecture) and 5+ years building digital products through Creatiloom, I'm bridging legacy technical fluency with contemporary web development practices.

This repository documents my progression across HTML/CSS, Python, and SQL – translating existing programming logic into current industry-standard technologies. Each project demonstrates applied learning rather than theoretical exercises, because real understanding comes from building solutions that solve actual problems.

Current focus: Web development, data architecture, and technical product strategy.
